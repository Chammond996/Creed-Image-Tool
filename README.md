# Creed Image Tool

This program is intended for recolouring .bmps and for slicing larger ones. More features may been added as required. This program uses: SFML2.6 - https://www.sfml-dev.org/ Dear Imgui - https://github.com/ocornut/imgui ImGuiFileDialogs - https://github.com/aiekick/ImGuiFileDialog

Once these dependencies have been linked it is ready to go.
